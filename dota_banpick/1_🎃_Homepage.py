st.markdown("""## How to use this tool

1. first of all, this app needs to confirm your position and hero pool 
   - after you provide your position, it will present you default hero pool for that position, and you need to remove unfamiliar heroes.
   - after that, it will present you all other uncommon heroes for that position, you can still add some if you want
   - this hero pool can be downloaded or uploaded
2. then you can move to BanPick page 
   - each hero will be attached with a radio button with three choices - Ally, Oppo, Ban
   - the tool shall provide you drafting suggestion and also not-good heroes. """)
